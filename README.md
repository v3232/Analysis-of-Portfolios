# A Whale off the Port(folio)

This project focuses on evaluating the performance of algorithmic, hedge, mutual fund portfolios, and a custom portfolio against the S&P TSX 60 Index. Here's a breakdown of key steps:

## Data Cleaning and Preparation

Read and clean whale portfolio returns, algorithmic returns, and S&P TSX 60 historical data.
Convert date formats, clean the values (e.g., removing symbols), calculate daily returns, and merge all datasets into a consolidated DataFrame.

## Performance Analysis

The cumulative returns for each portfolio are computed using (1 + returns).cumprod() and visualized using a line plot.
This helps in visualizing the overall growth of each portfolio over the entire time period.

## Risk Analysis

The risk analysis involves calculating standard deviations of daily returns, which measures the volatility of each portfolio.
A boxplot is used to visually represent the spread and identify which portfolios are riskier than the S&P TSX 60.
The rolling standard deviation is also calculated with a 21-day window, showing how the risk fluctuates over time for all portfolios.

## Correlation and Rolling Beta

A correlation matrix of the portfolios is computed and displayed via a heatmap, which helps identify any strong positive or negative correlations between portfolios and the benchmark (S&P TSX 60).
The 60-day rolling beta is calculated for each portfolio to examine how closely each portfolio moves in relation to the S&P TSX 60, offering insights into the sensitivity of portfolios relative to market movements.

## Sharpe Ratios

The Sharpe ratio is calculated to measure the risk-adjusted return of each portfolio. A higher Sharpe ratio indicates that the portfolio offers a better return per unit of risk.
A bar plot is used to visualize these ratios across all portfolios.

## Custom Portfolio Creation

Three new stocks are selected (L, OTEX, and SHOP), and their returns are calculated and combined to form a custom portfolio.
The custom portfolio is weighted equally across all three stocks and its performance is compared to the other portfolios.
The custom portfolioâ€™s daily returns are then joined with the consolidated returns of all portfolios, allowing for performance comparisons with established whale portfolios and the S&P TSX 60.
